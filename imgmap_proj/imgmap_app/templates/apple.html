    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Apple Stores are the official retail outlets of Apple Inc., designed not just for sales but also to showcase the brand’s identity and customer experience. The first Apple Store opened in 2001 in Virginia, USA, and today there are over 500 stores worldwide across major cities. Known for their sleek, minimalist architecture—often featuring glass facades, open layouts, and high-tech displays—these stores emphasize Apple’s design philosophy. They sell the full range of Apple products including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, Apple Watches, and accessories, while also offering technical support and repairs through the Genius Bar. Beyond shopping, many stores host Today at Apple sessions—free workshops on photography, music, coding, and creativity—making them community hubs for learning. The stores are strategically located in premium areas, from Fifth Avenue in New York to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, reinforcing Apple’s premium brand image. By blending retail with customer support and interactive experiences, Apple Stores have become a core part of Apple’s global success and brand loyalty.</p>
