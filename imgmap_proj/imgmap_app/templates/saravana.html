    <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: justify;">Saravana Stores is a famous retail chain based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, founded in 1969 by S. Selvarathinam Nadar and his brothers. Known as one of South India’s biggest “one-stop shopping” destinations, it offers a vast range of products including textiles, garments, jewellery, electronics, home appliances, kitchenware, furniture, and groceries. The brand caters mainly to middle-income customers with its strategy of providing a wide variety of goods at affordable prices, which has made it hugely popular. Starting as a small textile shop on Ranganathan Street in T. Nagar, it has now grown into massive multi-storied showrooms across Chennai and other Tamil Nadu cities like Madurai, Coimbatore, and Tirunelveli. Landmark outlets include “The Legend” at Padi and “The Crown Mall” on OMR, while its “Elite” jewellery showrooms target premium buyers. Saravana Stores employs thousands of people and generates revenues in the thousands of crores, making it a retail giant in the region. In recent years, it has also expanded into e-commerce with its SupersSmart app to compete with online players, though it continues to face challenges like heavy crowding, high operating costs, and competition from national and online retailers. Despite these, it remains a household name in Tamil Nadu, symbolizing affordability, variety, and large-scale retail shopping.</p>
