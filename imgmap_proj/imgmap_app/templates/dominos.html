    <p style="width: 1000px;position: relative; left: 930px;font-size: x-large;color: beige;">Domino’s Pizza is one of the world’s largest and most popular pizza chains, founded in 1960 in Michigan, USA, by Tom Monaghan. Known for its quick delivery and wide menu variety, Domino’s operates in over 90 countries, with more than 20,000 outlets globally.</p>

<p style="width: 1000px;position: relative; left: 930px;font-size: x-large;color: beige;">In India, Domino’s is managed by Jubilant FoodWorks Limited, which opened the first store in New Delhi in 1996. Since then, it has become the country’s most popular pizza brand, with thousands of outlets across cities and towns.</p>

<p style="width: 1000px;position: relative; left: 925px;font-size: x-large;color: beige;">Domino’s is famous for its 30-minute delivery promise, affordable pricing, and innovative menu tailored to local tastes—like Peppy Paneer, Mexican Green Wave, and Chicken Dominator in India. Beyond pizzas, it offers sides such as garlic breadsticks, pasta, chicken wings, and desserts like choco lava cake.</p>

<p style="width: 980px;position: relative; left: 930px;font-size: x-large;color: beige;">With a focus on convenience, speed, and customer satisfaction, Domino’s has grown into more than just a pizza chain—it’s a global leader in quick-service dining and a trusted brand for families, friends, and celebrations.</p>
